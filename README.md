## AI Integration

**Groq AI Integration for Enhanced Productivity**

One of the standout features of this Kanban application is the integration with **Groq AI** for intelligent task and card creation:

- **AI-Powered Task Generation**: Users can leverage Groq AI to automatically generate task descriptions and content
- **Smart Card Creation**: The system uses Groq's advanced language model to help create well-structured cards
- **Content Suggestions**: AI assistance for writing task descriptions and categorization
- **Time-Saving Automation**: Reduce manual input by letting AI suggest task details based on project context

This integration significantly enhances productivity by streamlining the task creation process and providing intelligent suggestions throughout the workflow.
