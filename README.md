2. Install Composer dependencies using the Laravel Sail installer container:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm \
       -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
       -v "$(pwd):/var/www/html" \
       -w /var/www/html \
       laravelsail/php84-composer:latest \
       composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
   ```

3. Copy the environment file:
